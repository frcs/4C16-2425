# 4C16-2425

4C16/5C16 is course on Machine Learning (ML), with a focus on Deep
Learning. It is a fourth and fifth year module offered by the
[Electronic & Electrical Engineering](https://www.tcd.ie/eleceng/)
department to the undergraduate students of [Trinity College
Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie).

Although Deep Learning has been around for quite a while, it has recently become
a disruptive technology that has been unexpectedly taking over operations of
technology companies around the world and disrupting all aspects of
society. When you read or hear about AI or machine Learning successes in the
news, it really means Deep Learning successes.

The course starts with an introduction to some essential aspects of Machine
Learning, including Least Squares, Logistic Regression and a quick overview of
some popular classification techniques.

Then the course dives into the fundamentals of Neural Nets, including Feed
Forward Neural Nets, Convolution Neural Nets and Recurrent Neural Nets and
Transformers.

The material has been constructed in collaboration with leading industrial
practitioners including Google, YouTube and Intel.

## Labs

We have designed a unique environment specifically for this course so that
students can learn best industry practices.

Our web platform can transparently connect students to a Google Cloud Platform
cluster or Colab via web based terminal/editor/Jupyter sessions. Labs use the
Keras framework and are automatically assessed using Git to give immediate
feedback.
